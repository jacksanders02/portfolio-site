      "description": "This module served as an introduction to general concepts and skills that are needed for a software engineering project (for example, different development methodologies such as agile & waterfall, usage of git for version control, and the ruby programming language). The module finished with a group project, in which I led a team of 7 computer science students to develop a twitter-like application for a fictional company, using <a href='https://sinatrarb.com' class='hover-link dark:hover-link-dark underline'>Sinatra</a>.",

      "description": "This module introduced me to programming using Java. It also helped me to deepen my understanding of object-oriented programming principles that I had developed during my A-Level computer science course. There was also an emphasis on producing readable code, which definitely helped me to develop my ability to produce high quality, maintainable, code.",

The module also helped me to expand on my A-Level knowledge of python and pathfinding algorithms such as Dijkstra's Algorithm and the A* Algorithm.",
